# SCARYCON FIRST EDITION

ScaryCon is a South African conference promoted by ScaryByte to demonstrate cybersecurity and cyber intelligence in its reality.

In a planet with finite resources, men, since the dawn of time and regardless of his social station, has fiercely protected his resources and privacy. The caveman used spears to protect himself and his livelihood. The rich, the working class, and the poor also protect their valuable property and privacy. 

Private and public institutions are entrusted by society to preserve the privacy, intellectual property and integrity of sensitive information. Scarybyte is a premium military grade cybersecurity and cyber intelligence company that is entrusted by both governments and the private sector to secure complex and modern  ICT infrastructures. 

We are an elite team of the modern digital security world. Our experience, skills, missions accomplished and accreditations of our experts has earned us an elite reputation.

In the ScaryCon conference, we are expecting to deliver a closer yet realistic journey to the ongoing and unseen malicious world.

In an increasingly connected world, threats can originate from anywhere and be executed by anyone, Human manipulation techniques are usually the most dangerous. They are typically organised groups such as hackers, scammers, rival nation-states or terrorists that are highly committed and have vast resources to harm human lives and critical infrastructures.

A friendly and a comprehensive approach will be adopted to demonstrate cybersecurity and cyber intelligence threats to enable the attendees to anticipate techniques and methods used by malicious actors. This philosophy has enabled the ScaryByte team to expand the offensive and defensive repertoire and endorse methods of advanced infiltration and exfiltration techniques.

We chose Halloween as the main day for the conference simply because  it reflects our brand name and joy as “scary talents”.
